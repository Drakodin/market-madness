# Market Madness
This is the codebase for HackGT8's Emerging Web Development workshop. Participants will learn ES6+ Javascript (JS) in which they will use to implement 5 key functions that make up the functionality of the project. If any participants were present for HackGTeeny 2021, this project is much different. Due to time constraints, HTML and CSS will be covered very lightly while Javascript will make up the majority of the workshop.

All code is provided by myself as a representative of GT Web Developers (GT WebDev)

## What are we building?
This is Market Madness, a simple browser game built with little to no external libraries. The entire functionality is handled with vanilla Javascript.

## File Structure
`completed` - The completed version of the code
`starter` - The starter version of the code (in which participants will be using)

Inside of both are the following
- `assets` - All images associated with this project. There should be only one: an image of a market stall I drew.
- `scripts` - All JS files associated with this project. There are 3.
  - `index.js` - The primary file in which participants will be working on. This file provides the core functionality of the game.
  - `market.js` - Contains most of the constant data to populate the environment.
  - `util.js` - Helper functions, classes (ES6+ addition), and other constants used to determine game settings.

## Files you will edit
- `scripts/index.js`

## Files included for good reference
- `scripts/util.js`

## Agenda
- HTML
  - Slides and examples
- CSS
  - Slides and examples
- Javascript
  - Slides and examples
  - Live coding following the project's starter code

### Workshop Notes
- Fast-paced, will talk and move quickly to fit the time period
- Ask questions to mentors if there is lecture. Otherwise, please wait until the designated times.

## Closing
If you have any questions at all, don't be afraid to ask! HackGT is a great time to learn new skills, but also to have fun!
