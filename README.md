# hackgt8-wd-ws
Workshop code for HackGT 8, provided by GT WebDev.

## What will we be building?
In the spirit of the marketplace, we will be building a website with a virtual street market. Feel free to customize this however which way you want as well :)

## What will we use to build this?
I'm providing two different builds for this website in this repository:
- React
- HTML/CSS/JS

However, for the workshop, I will not be demonstrating the React App so if you would like to, you can try out the React tutorial on your own.

## Workshop Agenda
- Introduction, GT Web Dev
- What is HTML, What is CSS, What is JS?
- Start building the website.
- Have fun!

## Closing
If you have any questions at all, don't be afraid to ask! HackGT is a great time to learn new skills, but also have fun!
