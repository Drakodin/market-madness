# hackgt8-wd-ws
Workshop code for HackGT 8, provided by GT WebDev.

## What will we be building?
In the spirit of the marketplace, we will be building a lightweight video game using only HTML, CSS, and JS.

## What will we use to build this?
I'm providing two different builds for this website in this repository:
- React
- HTML/CSS/JS

However, for the workshop, I will not be demonstrating the React App so if you would like to, you can try out the React tutorial on your own.

### File Structure
- `react-version/*` - The React code for this project. May be empty, may not be. It is implemented using Typescript, a library of Javascript that contains explicit type declarations, much like languages like Java or C++.

- `html-version/*` - The HTML/CSS/JS directory containing all of the code for this project that we will build. To run this site, load `index.html` in your browser of choice.

### Files you will edit
- `index.html`
- `index.css`
- `scripts/index.js`

### Files you should read for reference
Some of this syntax may be confusing as these files contain utility functions I wrote.
- `scripts/market.js`
- `scripts/util.js`
