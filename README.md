# Market Madness
This is the codebase for HackGT 8's Emerging Web Development workshop. Participants will learn ES6+ Javascript (JS) in which they will use to implement 5 key functions that make up the functionality of the project. If any participants were present for HackGTeeny 2021, this project is much different. Due to time constraints, HTML and CSS will be covered very lightly while Javascript will make up the majority of the workshop.

All code is provided by myself as a representative of GT Web Developers (GT WebDev)

## Instructions
This project is technically incomplete. Thus, you are free to modify it all you want! (though I would suggest not to use it as a final submission!) If you attended HackGTeeny, then the instructions are almost the same. In this case, there are more options.

### Cloning
Make sure you have Git installed before using this option. Click on the "Code" dropdown and copy the link. Next, open a terminal in the directory you would like this repository to be downloaded into. Type the command `git clone <link>` and press enter.

### Forking
If you have a Github account, you could also fork this repository. Forking (designated by the branching tree icon) creates a copy of this repository in your own account and you are free to play with it as much as you want and even push changes of your own. This was previously not possible if you cloned this repository (and you shouldn't either). Also, if you don't like the name, you can always change it :)

### Downloading the zip
There is a release available with an older version of this README, but has up to date code. You could also click on the "Code" drop down and choose to download the zip from there. These don't have the `.git` folder and thus do not have the ability to commit.

## What are we building?
This is Market Madness, a simple browser game built with little to no external libraries. The entire functionality is handled with vanilla Javascript which makes up well over half of all of the code in this repository.

## File Structure
`completed` - The completed version of the code
`starter` - The starter version of the code (in which participants will be using)

Inside of both are the following
- `assets` - All images associated with this project. There should be only one: an image of a market stall I drew.
- `scripts` - All JS files associated with this project. There are 3.
  - `index.js` - The primary file in which participants will be working on. This file provides the core functionality of the game.
  - `market.js` - Contains most of the constant data to populate the environment.
  - `util.js` - Helper functions, classes (ES6+ addition), and other constants used to determine game settings.

## Files you will edit
- `scripts/index.js`

## Files included for good reference
- `scripts/util.js`

## Agenda
- HTML
  - Slides and examples
- CSS
  - Slides and examples
- Javascript
  - Slides and examples
  - Live coding following the project's starter code

### Workshop Notes
- Fast-paced, will talk and move quickly to fit the time period
- Ask questions to mentors if there is lecture. Otherwise, please wait until the designated times.

## Closing
If you have any questions at all, don't be afraid to ask! HackGT is a great time to learn new skills, but also to have fun!
