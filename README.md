# hackgt8-wd-ws
Workshop code for HackGT 8, provided by GT WebDev.

## What will we be building?
In the spirit of the marketplace, we will be building a lightweight video game using only HTML, CSS, and JS.

## What will we use to build this?
I'm providing two different builds for this website in this repository:
- React
- HTML/CSS/JS

However, for the workshop, I will not be demonstrating the React App so if you would like to, you can try out the React tutorial on your own.
